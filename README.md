# Hellow Lonely Linux Users

Featuring Ubuntu, especially version 18.04 or later.

I couldn't work with the basic Bash shell, so it took me about three months to set up a terminal application, shell, editor, and theme settings that best fit my needs.

# 0. Work set Setting Process
1. Windows Terminal
2. Change main shell bash to zsh
3. Install oh-my-zsh
4. Download and set plugins - autojump, autosuggestion, syntax highlight
5. Install lsd
6. Download oh-my-zsh p10k theme
7. Install vim plugin - indentLine
8. Paste .vimrc, .zshrc, .p10k.zsh theme setting

# 1. Terminal Application
## Windows Terminal

This terminal app can maintain detailed settings and is free.

**One of the most powerful features is that its settings are stored in a JSON file. Therefore, if you upload the repository, you just need to download it and then copy and paste**

I hope you create a great setting if you read this. To reference these settings.json, make your own unique Windows Terminal settings.

**Check my essential shortcut setting**
I designed shortcuts to reduce unnecessary actions for the hand using the keyboard and the other hand holding the mouse.
